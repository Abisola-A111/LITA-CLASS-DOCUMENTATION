# Basics of Data Analysis

### What is Data Literacy
Data Literacy the ability to collect, analyze, interpret, and communicate data effectively. It involves having a basic understanding of data concept, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

### Data Generation
Data generation refers to the process of creating, collecting, or producing data through various methods.

#### Methods of Data Generation:
1. Surveys and questionnaires
2. Experiments and trials
3. Observational studies
4. Social media scraping
5. Web scraping and many more
    

#### Types of Data Generation:
1. Primary data generation: Collecting original data through surveys, experiments, or observations.
2. Secondary data generation: Analyzing existing data from external sources.

### Data Structure
 data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are 3 types of data structure 

#### 1. Structured Data
Defined format and organization, making it easily searchable, machine-readable, and analyzable.
Characteristics:
1. Highly organized
2. Well-defined schema
3. Easily searchable
4. Machine-readable
5. Quantifiable



#### 2. Semi-Structured Data

Some level of organization, but lacks strict formatting.
Characteristics:
1. Partially organized
2. Self-describing
3. Less rigid schema
4. Still machine-readable
5. May require parsing

#### 3. Unstructured Data

Lacks organization and formatting, making analysis challenging.
Characteristics:
1. Unorganized
2. No predefined schema
3. Difficult to search
4. Requires manual analysis
5. Qualitative

Examples:
Text documents (e.g., Word, PDF)  images,Videos,  Audio files, Social media posts,Emails e.t.c.


### Data Storage
Data storage refers to the devices, systems, and methods used to retain, protect, and retrieve digital data. Data can either be stored on cloud or in premises.

#### Cloud Storage:
Definition: Storing data online, accessed through the internet.
Examples:
1. Google Cloud Storage
2. Dropbox
3. iCloud

#### On-Premises Storage:
Definition:_ Storing data locally, within an organization's premises.
Examples:
1. Hard disk drives 
2. Solid-state drives 
3. Network-attached storage 
4. Storage area networks
5. Tape libraries

### Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of extracting insights and meaningful information from data.

#### Types of Data Analysis:

1. Descriptive Analysis (summarizing data)
2. Diagnostic Analysis (identifying causes)
3. Predictive Analysis (forecasting outcomes)
4. Prescriptive Analysis (recommending actions)

#### Data Analysis Steps:
1. Problem Definition

- Presentation tools: PowerPoint, Google Slides, Tableau

  
### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

ETL is a process used to extract data from multiple sources, transform it into a standardized format, and load it into a target system, such as a data warehouse or database.

ETL Process:
  -  Extract: Gather data from various sources, including:
    - Databases 
    - Files 
    - Web scraping
  - Transform: Clean, convert, and format data into a standardized structure:
    - Data cleansing (handling missing values, duplicates)
    - Data conversion (data type, format)
    - Data aggregation (grouping, summarizing)
    - Data merging (combining data from multiple sources)
-  Load:  Load transformed data into the target system:
    - Database 
    - Data warehouse
    - Cloud storage.

# SQL DOCUMENTATION
## My SQL Database Creation Journey
I recently acquired hands-on experience in creating a database using SQL, a fundamental skill for data management and analysis. Through a combination of training , practice exercises, and dedication, I successfully designed and implemented a fully functional database.

## Learning Process
My journey began with understanding the basics of SQL, including data types(varchar, nvarchar, int, tinyint and the like),tables, and relationships.
I focused on mastering essential SQL concepts, including:
- Creating and managing databases
- Designing tables and schemas
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data
- Querying data using SELECT statements
- Joining tables and subqueries

  ## Table Creation
I was able to successfully designed and creat a database table(Employee Table)using SQL, laying the foundation for data storage and management.

##   Data Insertion
I  Efficiently inserted data into the table, populating it with relevant information for analysis and querying.( StaffID, First name, Second name, gender, data of birth, Hiredate.)
