2. Experiments and trials
3. Observational studies
4. Social media scraping
5. Web scraping and many more
    

#### Types of Data Generation:
1. Primary data generation: Collecting original data through surveys, experiments, or observations.
2. Secondary data generation: Analyzing existing data from external sources.

### Data Structure
 data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are 3 types of data structure

I focused on mastering essential SQL concepts, including:
- Creating and managing databases
- Designing tables and schemas
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data
- Querying data using SELECT statements
- Joining tables and subqueries

  ## Table Creation
I was able to successfully designed and creat a database table(Employee Table)using SQL, laying the foundation for data storage and management.
