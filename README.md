## Data Generation
Data generation refers to the process of creating, collecting, or producing data through various methods.

### Methods of Data Generation:
1. Surveys and questionnaires

### Types of Data Generation:
1. Primary data generation: Collecting original data through surveys, experiments, or observations.
2. Secondary data generation: Analyzing existing data from external sources.

## Data Structure
 data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are 3 types of data structure 

### 1. Structured Data
Defined format and organization, making it easily searchable, machine-readable, and analyzable.
Characteristics:
1. Highly organized
2. Well-defined schema
3. Easily searchable
4. Machine-readable
5. Quantifiable



### 2. Semi-Structured Data

Some level of organization, but lacks strict formatting.
Characteristics:
1. Partially organized
2. Self-describing
3. Less rigid schema
4. Still machine-readable
5. May require parsing

### 3. Unstructured Data

Lacks organization and formatting, making analysis challenging.
Characteristics:
1. Unorganized
2. No predefined schema
3. Difficult to search
4. Requires manual analysis
5. Qualitative

Examples:
Text documents (e.g., Word, PDF)  images,Videos,  Audio files, Social media posts,Emails e.t.c.


## Data Storage
Data storage refers to the devices, systems, and methods used to retain, protect, and retrieve digital data. Data can either be stored on cloud or in premises.

### Cloud Storage:
Definition: Storing data online, accessed through the internet.
Examples:
1. Amazon S3
2. Google Cloud Storage
3. Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
4. Dropbox
5. iCloud

### On-Premises Storage:
Definition:_ Storing data locally, within an organization's premises.
Examples:
1. Hard disk drives (HDD)
2. Solid-state drives (SSD)
