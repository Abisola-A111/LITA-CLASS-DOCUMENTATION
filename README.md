# Basics of Data Analysis

### What is Data Literacy
Data Literacy the ability to collect, analyze, interpret, and communicate data effectively. It involves having a basic understanding of data concept, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

### Data Generation
Data generation refers to the process of creating, collecting, or producing data through various methods.

#### Methods of Data Generation:
1. Surveys and questionnaires
2. Experiments and trials
3. Observational studies
4. Social media scraping
5. Web scraping and many more
    

#### Types of Data Generation:
1. Primary data generation: Collecting original data through surveys, experiments, or observations.
2. Secondary data generation: Analyzing existing data from external sources.

### Data Structure
 data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are 3 types of data structure 

#### 1. Structured Data
Defined format and organization, making it easily searchable, machine-readable, and analyzable.
Characteristics:
1. Highly organized
2. Well-defined schema
3. Easily searchable
4. Machine-readable
5. Quantifiable



#### 2. Semi-Structured Data

Some level of organization, but lacks strict formatting.
Characteristics:
1. Partially organized
2. Self-describing
3. Less rigid schema
4. Still machine-readable
5. May require parsing

#### 3. Unstructured Data

Lacks organization and formatting, making analysis challenging.
Characteristics:
1. Unorganized
2. No predefined schema
3. Difficult to search
4. Requires manual analysis
5. Qualitative

Examples:
Text documents (e.g., Word, PDF)  images,Videos,  Audio files, Social media posts,Emails e.t.c.


### Data Storage
Data storage refers to the devices, systems, and methods used to retain, protect, and retrieve digital data. Data can either be stored on cloud or in premises.

#### Cloud Storage:
Definition: Storing data online, accessed through the internet.
Examples:
1. Google Cloud Storage
2. Dropbox
3. iCloud

#### On-Premises Storage:
Definition:_ Storing data locally, within an organization's premises.
Examples:
1. Hard disk drives 
2. Solid-state drives 
3. Network-attached storage 
4. Storage area networks
5. Tape libraries

### Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of extracting insights and meaningful information from data.

#### Types of Data Analysis:

1. Descriptive Analysis (summarizing data)
2. Diagnostic Analysis (identifying causes)
3. Predictive Analysis (forecasting outcomes)
4. Prescriptive Analysis (recommending actions)

#### Data Analysis Steps:
1. Problem Definition
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning
4. Data Transformation
5. Data Visualization
6. Pattern Identification
7. Insight Generation
8. Recommendation


#### Data Analysis Tools:
1. Excel
2. Tableau
3. Power BI
4. Python 
5. SQL
6. SPSS

### Statistics

Statistics is the study of collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

#### Branches of Statistics:

1. Descriptive Statistics (summarizing data)
2. Inferential Statistics (making conclusions about populations)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (identifying patterns)


#### Statistical Tools:
1. Python (NumPy, Pandas)
2. Excel
3. SPSS
4. SAS


### Data-Driven Decision Making

Data-Driven decision making is an approach to decision making that relies on data analysis and interpretation to inform and support decisions.

#### Key Principles:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Analysis
3. Insight Generation
4. Decision Making
5. Continuous Monitoring and adjustment 

#### Benefits
1. Improved Accuracy
2. Enhanced Objectivity
3. Increased Efficiency
4. Better Risk Management
5. Data-Driven Culture
6. Informed Strategic Planning
7. Optimized Resource Allocation
8. Improved Customer Insights

### Steps to Implement DDDM:

1. Define Business Objectives
2. Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
3. Collect and Integrate Data
4. Analyze and Interpret Data
5. Develop Data-Driven Insights
6. Communicate Insights to Stakeholders
7. Make Data-Informed Decisions
8. Monitor and Evaluate Outcomes

   
### Data Analysis Life Cycle

The Data Analysis Life Cycle is a structured approach to extracting insights from data. It consists of six stages:
![image alt](image_url)(https://github.com/Abisola-A111/LITA-CLASS-DOCUMENTATION/blob/main/LITA%20png.png)

#### 1. Ingestion
- Collecting and gathering data from various sources
- Data sources: databases, files, APIs, web scraping
- Data formats: CSV, JSON, Excel, text files

#### 2. Transformation
- Cleaning and preprocessing data for analysis
- Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization
- Data transformation tools: Power BI, NumPy, SQL

#### 3. Modeling

- Developing statistical or machine learning models
- Model types: regression, classification, clustering, neural networks

#### 4. Visualization

- Creating graphical representations of data insights
- Visualization types: charts, plots, heatmaps, dashboards
- Visualization tools: Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI

#### 5. Analysis

- Interpreting results and drawing conclusions
- Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations
- Analysis techniques: statistical inference, hypothesis testing

#### 6. Presentation

- Communicating findings to stakeholders
- Presentation formats: reports, dashboards, slides, storytelling
- Presentation tools: PowerPoint, Google Slides, Tableau

  
### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

ETL is a process used to extract data from multiple sources, transform it into a standardized format, and load it into a target system, such as a data warehouse or database.

ETL Process:
  -  Extract: Gather data from various sources, including:
    - Databases 
    - Files 
    - Web scraping
  - Transform: Clean, convert, and format data into a standardized structure:
    - Data cleansing (handling missing values, duplicates)
    - Data conversion (data type, format)
    - Data aggregation (grouping, summarizing)
    - Data merging (combining data from multiple sources)
-  Load:  Load transformed data into the target system:
    - Database 
    - Data warehouse
    - Cloud storage.
